   abstract = {The nucleoids of undamaged Escherichia coli cells have a characteristic shape and number, which is dependent on the growth medium. Upon induction of the SOS response by a low dose of UV irradiation an extensive reorganization of the nucleoids occurred. Two distinct phases were observed by fluorescence microscopy. First, the nucleoids were found to change shape and fuse into compact structures at midcell. The compaction of the nucleoids lasted for 10-20 min and was followed by a phase where the DNA was dispersed throughout the cells. This second phase lasted for ~1 h. The compaction was found to be dependent on the recombination proteins RecA, RecO and RecR as well as the SOS-inducible, SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes)- like protein RecN. RecN protein is produced in high amounts during the first part of the SOS response. It is possible that the RecN-mediated 'compact DNA' stage at the beginning of the SOS response serves to stabilize damaged DNA prior to recombination and repair. © 2014 The Authors.},

   abstract = {Cell biology is increasingly dependent on quantitative methods resulting in the need for microscopic labelling technologies that are highly sensitive and specific. Whilst the use of fluorescent proteins has led to major advances, they also suffer from their relatively low brightness and photo-stability, making the detection of very low abundance proteins using fluorescent protein-based methods challenging. Here, we characterize the use of the self-labelling protein tag called HaloTag, in conjunction with an organic fluorescent dye, to label and accurately count endogenous proteins present in very low numbers (<7) in individual Escherichia coli cells. This procedure can be used to detect single molecules in fixed cells with conventional epifluorescence illumination and a standard microscope. We show that the detection efficiency of proteins labelled with the HaloTag is ≥80%, which is on par or better than previous techniques. Therefore, this method offers a simple and attractive alternative to current procedures to detect low abundance molecules.},

A fusion protein of a fast-maturing yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and a membrane-targeting peptide was expressed under a repressed condition. The membrane-localized YFP can be detected with single-molecule sensitivity. We found that the protein molecules are produced in bursts, with each burst originating from a stochastically transcribed single messenger RNA molecule, and that protein copy numbers in the bursts follow a geometric distribution. The quantitative study of low-level gene expression demonstrates the potential of single-molecule experiments in elucidating the workings of fundamental biological processes in living cells.},

Furthermore, we characterized the nonspecific binding to DNA, one-dimensional (1D) diffusion along DNA segments, and 3D translocation among segments through cytoplasm at the single-molecule level. In searching for the operator, a lac repressor spends ∼90% of time nonspecifically bound to and diffusing along DNA with a residence time of <S milliseconds.

   abstract = {Homologous recombination is essential for the accurate repair of double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs)1. Initially, the RecBCD complex2 resects the ends of the DSB into 3′ single-stranded DNA on which a RecA filament assembles3. Next, the filament locates the homologous repair template on the sister chromosome4. Here we directly visualize the repair of DSBs in single cells, using high-throughput microfluidics and fluorescence microscopy. We find that, in Escherichia coli, repair of DSBs between segregated sister loci is completed in 15 ± 5 min (mean ± s.d.)&nbsp;with minimal fitness loss. We further show that the search takes less than 9 ± 3 min (mean&nbsp;±&nbsp;s.d)&nbsp;and is mediated by a thin, highly dynamic RecA filament that stretches throughout the cell. We propose that the architecture of the RecA filament effectively reduces search dimensionality. This model predicts a search time that is consistent with our measurement and is corroborated by the observation that the search time does not depend on the length of the cell or the amount of DNA. Given the abundance of RecA homologues5, we believe this model to be&nbsp;widely conserved across living organisms. Observations of rapid repair of double-stranded DNA breaks in sister choromosomes in Escherichia coli are consistent with a reduced-dimensionality-search model of RecA-mediated repair.},

@article{Sinha2018,
   abstract = {It was recently reported that the recBC mutants of Escherichia coli, deficient for DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, have a decreased copy number of their terminus region. We previously showed that this deficit resulted from DNA loss after post-replicative breakage of one of the two sister-chromosome termini at cell division. A viable cell and a dead cell devoid of terminus region were thus produced and, intriguingly, the reaction was transmitted to the following generations. Using genome marker frequency profiling and observation by microscopy of specific DNA loci within the terminus, we reveal here the origin of this phenomenon. We observed that terminus DNA loss was reduced in a recA mutant by the double-strand DNA degradation activity of RecBCD. The terminus-less cell produced at the first cell division was less prone to divide than the one produced at the next generation. DNA loss was not heritable if the chromosome was linearized in the terminus and occurred at chromosome termini that were unable to segregate after replication. We propose that in a recB mutant replication fork breakage results in the persistence of a linear DNA tail attached to a circular chromosome. Segregation of the linear and circular parts of this “σ-replicating chromosome” causes terminus DNA breakage during cell division. One daughter cell inherits a truncated linear chromosome and is not viable. The other inherits a circular chromosome attached to a linear tail ending in the chromosome terminus. Replication extends this tail, while degradation of its extremity results in terminus DNA loss. Repeated generation and segregation of new σ-replicating chromosomes explains the heritability of post-replicative breakage. Our results allow us to determine that in E. coli at each generation, 18% of cells are subject to replication fork breakage at dispersed, potentially random, chromosomal locations.},

   abstract = {Our previous paper (Wilkinson et al, 2016) used high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy to solve the structure of the Escherichia coli RecBCD complex, which acts in both the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks and the degradation of bacteriophage DNA. To counteract the latter activity, bacteriophage λ encodes a small protein inhibitor called Gam that binds to RecBCD and inactivates the complex. Here, we show that Gam inhibits RecBCD by competing at the DNA-binding site. The interaction surface is extensive and involves molecular mimicry of the DNA substrate. We also show that expression of Gam in E. coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae increases sensitivity to fluoroquinolones; antibacterials that kill cells by inhibiting topoisomerases and inducing double-stranded DNA breaks. Furthermore, fluoroquinolone-resistance in K. pneumoniae clinical isolates is reversed by expression of Gam. Together, our data explain the synthetic lethality observed between topoisomerase-induced DNA breaks and the RecBCD gene products, suggesting a new co-antibacterial strategy.},

   abstract = {The recombinational hot spot X modulates the nuclease and helicase activities of the RecBCD enzyme, leading to generation of an early DNA intermediate for homologous recombination. Here we identify the subunit location of the nuclease active site in RecBCD. The isolated RecB protein cleaves circular single-stranded M13 phage DNA, but RecB1-929, comprising only the 100 kDa N-terminal domain of RecB, does not. We reported previously that the reconstituted RecB1-929CD enzyme also is not a nuclease, suggesting that the C-terminal 30 kDa domain of RecB is a non-specific ssDNA endonuclease. However, we were unable to detect nuclease activity with the subtilisin-generated C-terminal 30 kDa fragment of RecB. Since the subtilisin-generated fragment did not bind to a ssDNA-agarose column, we designed a chimeric enzyme by attaching the C-terminal 30 kDa domain of RecB to the gene 32 protein of T4 phage, a ssDNA binding protein that does not have strand scission ability. In addition, Asp427 in the chimeric enzyme (Asp1080 in RecB), a residue that is conserved among several RecB homologs, was substituted to alanine (the D427A mutant). The wild-type chimeric enzyme cleaves the M13 DNA and the D427A mutation abolishes the endonuclease activity of the chimeric enzyme but does not affect its DNA binding ability. This finding indicates an unusual bipartite nature in the structural organization of RecB, in which the DNA-binding function is located in the N-terminal 100 kDa domain and the nuclease catalytic domain is located in the C-terminal 30 kDa domain. The purified RecB(D1080A)CD mutant is a processive helicase but not a nuclease, demonstrating that RecBCD has a single nuclease active site in the C terminal 30 kDa domain of RecB.},

   abstract = {Homologous recombination and double-stranded DNA break repair in Escherichia coli are initiated by the multifunctional RecBCD enzyme. After binding to a double-stranded DNA end, the RecBCD enzyme unwinds and degrades the DNA processively. This processing is regulated by the recombination hot spot, Chi (χ: 5'-GCTGGTGG-3'), which induces a switch in the polarity of DNA degradation and activates RecBCD enzyme to coordinate the loading of the DNA strand exchange protein, RecA, onto the single-stranded DNA products of unwinding. Recently, a single mutation in RecB, Asp-1080 → Ala, was shown to create an enzyme (RecB(D1080A)CD) that is a processive helicase but not a nuclease. Here we show that the RecB(D1080A)CD enzyme is also unable to coordinate the loading of the RecA protein, regardless of whether χ sites are present in the DNA. However, the RecB(D1080A)CD enzyme does respond to χ sites by inactivating in a χ-dependent manner. These data define a locus of the RecBCD enzyme that is essential not only for nuclease function but also for the coordination of RecA protein loading.},

   abstract = {The RecA loading activity of the RecBCD enzyme, together with its helicase and 5′ → 3′ exonuclease activities, is essential for recombination in Escherichia coli. One particular mutant in the nuclease catalytic center of RecB, i.e., recB1080, produces an enzyme that does not have nuclease activity and is unable to load RecA protein onto single-stranded DNA. There are, however, previously published contradictory data on the recombination proficiency of this mutant. In a recF- background the recB1080 mutant is recombination deficient, whereas in a recF+ genetic background it is recombination proficient. A possible explanation for these contrasting phenotypes may be that the RecFOR system promotes RecA-single-strand DNA filament formation and replaces the RecA loading defect of the RecB1080CD enzyme. We tested this hypothesis by using three in vivo assays. We compared the recombination proficiencies of recB1080, rec0, recR, and RecF single mutants and recB1080 rec0, recB1080 recR, and recB1080 recF double mutants. We show that RecFOR functions rescue the repair and recombination deficiency of the recB1080 mutant and that RecA loading is independent of RecFOR in the recB1080 recD double mutant where this activity is provided by the RecB1080C(D-) enzyme. According to our results as well as previous data, three essential activities for the initiation of recombination in the recB1080 mutant are provided by different proteins, i.e., helicase activity by RecB1080CD, 5′ → 3′ exonuclease by RecJ- and RecA-single-stranded DNA filament formation by RecFOR.},
