   abstract = {Cell biology is increasingly dependent on quantitative methods resulting in the need for microscopic labelling technologies that are highly sensitive and specific. Whilst the use of fluorescent proteins has led to major advances, they also suffer from their relatively low brightness and photo-stability, making the detection of very low abundance proteins using fluorescent protein-based methods challenging. Here, we characterize the use of the self-labelling protein tag called HaloTag, in conjunction with an organic fluorescent dye, to label and accurately count endogenous proteins present in very low numbers (<7) in individual Escherichia coli cells. This procedure can be used to detect single molecules in fixed cells with conventional epifluorescence illumination and a standard microscope. We show that the detection efficiency of proteins labelled with the HaloTag is ≥80%, which is on par or better than previous techniques. Therefore, this method offers a simple and attractive alternative to current procedures to detect low abundance molecules.},

A fusion protein of a fast-maturing yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and a membrane-targeting peptide was expressed under a repressed condition. The membrane-localized YFP can be detected with single-molecule sensitivity. We found that the protein molecules are produced in bursts, with each burst originating from a stochastically transcribed single messenger RNA molecule, and that protein copy numbers in the bursts follow a geometric distribution. The quantitative study of low-level gene expression demonstrates the potential of single-molecule experiments in elucidating the workings of fundamental biological processes in living cells.},

   abstract = {Homologous recombination is essential for the accurate repair of double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs)1. Initially, the RecBCD complex2 resects the ends of the DSB into 3′ single-stranded DNA on which a RecA filament assembles3. Next, the filament locates the homologous repair template on the sister chromosome4. Here we directly visualize the repair of DSBs in single cells, using high-throughput microfluidics and fluorescence microscopy. We find that, in Escherichia coli, repair of DSBs between segregated sister loci is completed in 15 ± 5 min (mean ± s.d.)&nbsp;with minimal fitness loss. We further show that the search takes less than 9 ± 3 min (mean&nbsp;±&nbsp;s.d)&nbsp;and is mediated by a thin, highly dynamic RecA filament that stretches throughout the cell. We propose that the architecture of the RecA filament effectively reduces search dimensionality. This model predicts a search time that is consistent with our measurement and is corroborated by the observation that the search time does not depend on the length of the cell or the amount of DNA. Given the abundance of RecA homologues5, we believe this model to be&nbsp;widely conserved across living organisms. Observations of rapid repair of double-stranded DNA breaks in sister choromosomes in Escherichia coli are consistent with a reduced-dimensionality-search model of RecA-mediated repair.},

@article{Sinha2018,
   abstract = {It was recently reported that the recBC mutants of Escherichia coli, deficient for DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, have a decreased copy number of their terminus region. We previously showed that this deficit resulted from DNA loss after post-replicative breakage of one of the two sister-chromosome termini at cell division. A viable cell and a dead cell devoid of terminus region were thus produced and, intriguingly, the reaction was transmitted to the following generations. Using genome marker frequency profiling and observation by microscopy of specific DNA loci within the terminus, we reveal here the origin of this phenomenon. We observed that terminus DNA loss was reduced in a recA mutant by the double-strand DNA degradation activity of RecBCD. The terminus-less cell produced at the first cell division was less prone to divide than the one produced at the next generation. DNA loss was not heritable if the chromosome was linearized in the terminus and occurred at chromosome termini that were unable to segregate after replication. We propose that in a recB mutant replication fork breakage results in the persistence of a linear DNA tail attached to a circular chromosome. Segregation of the linear and circular parts of this “σ-replicating chromosome” causes terminus DNA breakage during cell division. One daughter cell inherits a truncated linear chromosome and is not viable. The other inherits a circular chromosome attached to a linear tail ending in the chromosome terminus. Replication extends this tail, while degradation of its extremity results in terminus DNA loss. Repeated generation and segregation of new σ-replicating chromosomes explains the heritability of post-replicative breakage. Our results allow us to determine that in E. coli at each generation, 18% of cells are subject to replication fork breakage at dispersed, potentially random, chromosomal locations.},

To counteract the latter activity, bacteriophage λ encodes a small protein inhibitor called Gam that binds to RecBCD and inactivates the complex. Here, we show that Gam inhibits RecBCD by competing at the DNA-binding site. The interaction surface is extensive and involves molecular mimicry of the DNA substrate. We also show that expression of Gam in E. coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae increases sensitivity to fluoroquinolones; antibacterials that kill cells by inhibiting topoisomerases and inducing double-stranded DNA breaks. Furthermore, fluoroquinolone-resistance in K. pneumoniae clinical isolates is reversed by expression of Gam. Together, our data explain the synthetic lethality observed between topoisomerase-induced DNA breaks and the RecBCD gene products, suggesting a new co-antibacterial strategy.},

Upon induction of the SOS response by a low dose of UV irradiation an extensive reorganization of the nucleoids occurred. Two distinct phases were observed by fluorescence microscopy. First, the nucleoids were found to change shape and fuse into compact structures at midcell. The compaction of the nucleoids lasted for 10-20 min and was followed by a phase where the DNA was dispersed throughout the cells. This second phase lasted for ~1 h. The compaction was found to be dependent on the recombination proteins RecA, RecO and RecR as well as the SOS-inducible, SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes)- like protein RecN. RecN protein is produced in high amounts during the first part of the SOS response. It is possible that the RecN-mediated 'compact DNA' stage at the beginning of the SOS response serves to stabilize damaged DNA prior to recombination and repair. © 2014 The Authors.},

   abstract = {The recombinational hot spot X modulates the nuclease and helicase activities of the RecBCD enzyme, leading to generation of an early DNA intermediate for homologous recombination. Here we identify the subunit location of the nuclease active site in RecBCD. The isolated RecB protein cleaves circular single-stranded M13 phage DNA, but RecB1-929, comprising only the 100 kDa N-terminal domain of RecB, does not. We reported previously that the reconstituted RecB1-929CD enzyme also is not a nuclease, suggesting that the C-terminal 30 kDa domain of RecB is a non-specific ssDNA endonuclease. However, we were unable to detect nuclease activity with the subtilisin-generated C-terminal 30 kDa fragment of RecB. Since the subtilisin-generated fragment did not bind to a ssDNA-agarose column, we designed a chimeric enzyme by attaching the C-terminal 30 kDa domain of RecB to the gene 32 protein of T4 phage, a ssDNA binding protein that does not have strand scission ability. In addition, Asp427 in the chimeric enzyme (Asp1080 in RecB), a residue that is conserved among several RecB homologs, was substituted to alanine (the D427A mutant). The wild-type chimeric enzyme cleaves the M13 DNA and the D427A mutation abolishes the endonuclease activity of the chimeric enzyme but does not affect its DNA binding ability. This finding indicates an unusual bipartite nature in the structural organization of RecB, in which the DNA-binding function is located in the N-terminal 100 kDa domain and the nuclease catalytic domain is located in the C-terminal 30 kDa domain. The purified RecB(D1080A)CD mutant is a processive helicase but not a nuclease, demonstrating that RecBCD has a single nuclease active site in the C terminal 30 kDa domain of RecB.},

   abstract = {The RecA loading activity of the RecBCD enzyme, together with its helicase and 5′ → 3′ exonuclease activities, is essential for recombination in Escherichia coli. One particular mutant in the nuclease catalytic center of RecB, i.e., recB1080, produces an enzyme that does not have nuclease activity and is unable to load RecA protein onto single-stranded DNA. There are, however, previously published contradictory data on the recombination proficiency of this mutant. In a recF- background the recB1080 mutant is recombination deficient, whereas in a recF+ genetic background it is recombination proficient. A possible explanation for these contrasting phenotypes may be that the RecFOR system promotes RecA-single-strand DNA filament formation and replaces the RecA loading defect of the RecB1080CD enzyme. We tested this hypothesis by using three in vivo assays. We compared the recombination proficiencies of recB1080, rec0, recR, and RecF single mutants and recB1080 rec0, recB1080 recR, and recB1080 recF double mutants. We show that RecFOR functions rescue the repair and recombination deficiency of the recB1080 mutant and that RecA loading is independent of RecFOR in the recB1080 recD double mutant where this activity is provided by the RecB1080C(D-) enzyme. According to our results as well as previous data, three essential activities for the initiation of recombination in the recB1080 mutant are provided by different proteins, i.e., helicase activity by RecB1080CD, 5′ → 3′ exonuclease by RecJ- and RecA-single-stranded DNA filament formation by RecFOR.},

Interaction with Chi causes an attenuation of the RecBCD enzyme's vigorous nuclease activity, switches the polarity of the attenuated nuclease activity to the 5' strand, changes the operation of its motor subunits, and instructs the enzyme to begin loading the RecA protein onto the resultant Chi-containing single-stranded DNA.

Here, we develop a two-color fluorescent reporter to directly observe the resection of individual inducible DSB sites within live E. coli cells. Realtime imaging shows that RecBCD during end resection degrades DNA with remarkably high speed (i"1.6 kb/s) and high processivity (>7sim;100 kb). The results show a pronounced asymmetry in the processing of the two DNA ends of a DSB, where much longer stretches of DNA are degraded in the direction of terminus. The microscopy observations are confirmed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction measurements of the DNA degradation. Deletion of the recD gene drastically decreased the length of resection, allowing for recombination with short ectopic plasmid homologies and significantly increasing the efficiency of horizontal gene transfer between strains.We thus visualized and quantified DNA end resection by the RecBCD complex in live cells, recorded DNA-degradation linked to end resection and uncovered a general relationship between the length of end resection and the choice of the homologous recombination template.},

Interaction is with a conserved element of the RecA-fold, but because the binding to noncognate proteins decreases in a phylogenetically consistent way, species-specific interactions are also present. RecBnuc does not impede activities of RecA that are important to DNA strand exchange, consistent with its role in targeting of RecA. Modeling predicts the interaction interface for the RecA-RecBCD complex.

   abstract = {We report here an unusual mechanism for enzyme regulation: the disassembly of all three subunits of RecBCD enzyme after its interaction with a Chi recombination hot spot. The enzyme, which is essential for the major pathway of recombination in Escherichia coli, acts on linear double-stranded DNA bearing a Chi site to produce single-stranded DNA substrates for strand exchange by RecA protein. We show that after reaction with DNA bearing Chi sites, RecBCD enzyme is inactivated and the three subunits migrate as separate species during glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation or native gel electrophoresis. This Chi-mediated inactivation and disassembly of purified RecBCD enzyme can account for the previously reported Chi-dependent loss of Chi activity in E. coli cells containing broken DNA. Our results support a model of recombination in which Chi regulates one RecBCD enzyme molecule to make a single recombinational exchange ('one enzyme-one exchange' hypothesis).},

We studied the mechanism of DSB formation by direct measure of the amount of in vivo linear DNA in Escherichia coli cells that lack the RecBCD recombination complex and by genetic means. The RuvABC proteins, which catalyze migration and cleavage of Holliday junctions, are responsible for the occurrence of DSBs at arrested replication forks. In cells proficient for RecBC, RuvAB is uncoupled from RuvC and DSBs may be prevented. This may be explained if a Holliday junction forms upon replication fork arrest, by annealing of the two nascent strands.

   abstract = {Chromosomal replication is the major source of spontaneous DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in living cells. Repair of these DSBs is essential for cell viability, and accuracy of repair is critical to avoid chromosomal rearrangements. Repair of replication-dependent DSBs occurs primarily by homologous recombination with a sister chromosome. However, this reaction has never been visualized at a defined chromosomal locus, so little is known about its spatial or temporal dynamics. Repair of a replication-independent DSB generated in Escherichia coli by a rare-cutting endonuclease leads to the formation of a bundle of RecA filaments. In this study, we show that in contrast, repair of a replication-dependent DSB involves a transient RecA focus localized in the central region of the cell in which the DNA is replicated. The recombining loci remain centrally located with restricted movement before segregating with little extension to the period of postreplicative sister-chromosome cohesion. The spatial and temporal efficiency of this reaction is remarkable.},

   abstract = {Abstract— Degradation of the DNA of a rec‐ mutant of Escherichia coli K12 (JC1569 b) induced by u.v. light was investigated. The rate of degradation was much larger by growing bacteria than by stationary cells. When growing bacteria were starved for amino acids, their DNA became resistant to irradiation. The mode of u.v.‐induced degradation was investigated by comparing the time course of release from the acid‐insoluble fraction of the label for two growing cultures; the one was pulse‐labeled with 3H‐thymidine and the other was pulse‐labeled and chased thereafter for 12 min. It was found that the label incorporated into the former culture begins to be lost from the acid‐insoluble fraction prior to the loss of the label incorporated into the latter culture. It was concluded that breakdown of the replicating point precedes degradation of the bulk of the DNA. This result suggested that the replicating point is a sensitive site to irradiation and the u.v.‐induced degradation of DNA seemed to be influenced by the state of chromosome at the time of irradiation. Experiments of centrifugation of lysed spheroplasts of bacteria uniformly labeled with 3H‐thymidine in alkaline sucrose demonstrated that DNA of low molecular weight appeared after irradiation with only 5 ergs/ mm2, and that the molecular weight could not be restored by post‐irradiation incubation. Considering these results, an hypothesis is proposed concerning the initiation of induced degradation of the DNA of the rec‐ mutant. Copyright © 1968, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

Res. 168, 499–506 (2007).After UV irradiation, recA mutants fail to recover replication, and a dramatic and nearly complete degradation of the genomic DNA occurs. Although the RecBCD helicase/nuclease complex is known to mediate this catastrophic DNA degradation, it is not known how or where this degradation is initiated. Previous studies have speculated that RecBCD targets and initiates degradation from the nascent DNA at replication forks arrested by DNA damage. To test this question, we examined which enzymes were responsible for the degradation of genomic DNA and the nascent DNA in UV-irradiated recA cells. We show here that, although RecBCD degrades the genomic DNA after UV irradiation, it does not target the nascent DNA at arrested replication forks. Instead, we observed that the nascent DNA at arrested replication forks in recA cultures is degraded by RecJ/RecQ, similar to what occurs in wild-type cultures. These findings indicate that the genomic DNA degradation and nascent DNA degradation in UV-irradiated recA mutants are mediated separately through RecBCD and RecJ/RecQ, respectively. In addition, they demonstrate that RecBCD initiates degradation at a site(s) other than the arrested replication fork directly.},

   abstract = {The RecBCD enzyme of Escherichia coli is an ATP-dependent DNA exonuclease and a helicase. Its exonuclease activity is subject to regulation by an octameric nucleotide sequence called χ. In this study, site-directed mutations were made in the carboxyl-terminal nuclease domain of the RecB subunit, and their effects on RecBCD's enzymatic activities were investigated. Mutation of two amino acid residues, Asp1067 and Lys1082, abolished nuclease activity on both single- and double-stranded DNA. Together with Asp1080, these residues compose a motif that is similar to one shown to form the active site of several restriction endonucleases. The nuclease reactions catalyzed by the RecBCD enzyme should therefore follow the same mechanism as these restriction endonucleases. Furthermore, the mutant enzymes were unable to produce χ-specific fragments that are thought to result from the 3'-5' and 5'-3' single-stranded exonuclease activities of the enzyme during its reaction with χ-containing double-stranded DNA. The results show that the nuclease active site in the RecB C-terminal 30-kDa domain is the universal nuclease active site of RecBCD that is responsible for DNA degradation in both directions during the reaction with double-stranded DNA. A novel explanation for the observed nuclease polarity switch and RecBCD-DNA interaction is offered.},

After binding to a double-stranded DNA end, the RecBCD enzyme unwinds and degrades the DNA processively. This processing is regulated by the recombination hot spot, Chi (χ: 5'-GCTGGTGG-3'), which induces a switch in the polarity of DNA degradation and activates RecBCD enzyme to coordinate the loading of the DNA strand exchange protein, RecA, onto the single-stranded DNA products of unwinding. Recently, a single mutation in RecB, Asp-1080 → Ala, was shown to create an enzyme (RecB(D1080A)CD) that is a processive helicase but not a nuclease. Here we show that the RecB(D1080A)CD enzyme is also unable to coordinate the loading of the RecA protein, regardless of whether χ sites are present in the DNA. However, the RecB(D1080A)CD enzyme does respond to χ sites by inactivating in a χ-dependent manner. These data define a locus of the RecBCD enzyme that is essential not only for nuclease function but also for the coordination of RecA protein loading.},

By combining genetic, biochemical, and molecular biology approaches, we demonstrate that exonuclease VII (ExoVII) excises quinolone-induced trapped DNA gyrase, an essential prokaryotic type IIA topoisomerase. We show that ExoVII repairs trapped type IIA TOPcc and that ExoVII displays tyrosyl nuclease activity for the tyrosyl-DNA linkage on the 5′-DNA overhangs corresponding to trapped type IIA TOPcc. ExoVII-deficient bacteria fail to remove trapped DNA gyrase, consistent with their hypersensitivity to quinolones. We also identify an ExoVII inhibitor that synergizes with the antimicrobial activity of quinolones, including in quinolone-resistant bacterial strains, further demonstrating the functional importance of ExoVII for the repair of type IIA TOPcc.},

   abstract = {Quinolone drugs can inhibit bacterial DNA replication, via interaction with the type II topoisomerase DNA gyrase. Using a DNA template containing a preferred site for quinolone-induced gyrase cleavage, we have demonstrated that the passage of the bacteriophage T7 replication complex is blocked in vitro by the formation of a gyrase-drug-DNA complex. The majority of the polymerase is arrested approximately 10 bp upstream of this preferred site, although other minor sites of blocking have been observed. The ability of mutant gyrase proteins to arrest DNA replication in vitro has been investigated. Gyrase containing mutations in the A subunit at either the active-site tyrosine (Tyr122) or Ser83 (a residue known to be involved in quinolone interaction) failed to halt the progress of the polymerase. A low-level, quinolone-resistant mutation in the B subunit of gyrase showed reduced blocking compared to wild-type. We have demonstrated that DNA cleavage and replication blocking occur on similar time-scales and we conclude that formation of the cleavable complex is a prerequisite for polymerase blocking. Additionally, we have shown that collision of the replication proteins with the gyrase-drug-DNA complex is not sufficient to render this complex irreversible and that further factors must be involved in processing this stalled complex. © 2000 Academic Press.},

   abstract = {The fluoroquinolones are broad-spectrum antibacterial agents that are becoming increasingly popular as bacterial resistance erodes the effectiveness of other agents (fluoroquin-olone sales accounted for 18% of the antibacterial market in 2006) (41). One of the attractive features of the quinolones is their ability to kill bacteria rapidly, an ability that differs widely among the various derivatives. For example, quinolones differ in rate and extent of killing, in the need for aerobic metabolism to kill cells, and in the effect of protein synthesis inhibitors on quinolone lethality. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these differences could lead to new ways for identifying the most bactericidal quinolone derivatives. Before describing the types of damage caused by the quin-olones, it is useful to define lethal activity. Operationally, it is the ability of drug treatment to reduce the number of viable cells, usually measured as CFU on drug-free agar after treatment. This assay is distinct from measurements that detect inhibition of growth (e.g., MIC), since with the latter bacteria are exposed to drug throughout the measurement. The distinction between killing and blocking growth is important because it allows susceptibility determinations to be related to particular biological processes. For example, inhibition of growth is typically reversed by the removal of drug, while cell death is not. Thus, biochemical events associated with blocking growth should be readily reversible, while those responsible for cell death should be difficult to reverse. Reversibility can be used to distinguish among quinolone derivatives and assign functions to particular aspects of drug structure. Moreover, protective functions, such as repair and stress responses, can be distinguished by whether their absence affects inhibition of growth, killing, or both. The intracellular targets of the quinolones are two DNA topoisomerases: gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Gyrase tends to be the primary target in gram-negative bacteria, while topo-isomerase IV is preferentially inhibited by most quinolones in gram-positive organisms (28). Both enzymes use a double-strand DNA passage mechanism, and it is likely that quinolone biochemistry is similar for both. However, physiological differences between the enzymes exist, some of which may bear on quinolone lethality. In the present minireview we consider cell death through a two-part "poison" hypothesis in which the quinolones form reversible drug-topoisomerase-DNA complexes that subsequently lead to several types of irreversible (lethal) damage. Other consequences of quinolone treatment, such as depletion of gyrase and topoisomerase IV activity, are probably less immediate (42). To provide a framework for considering quin-olone lethality, we begin by briefly describing the drug-topo-isomerase-DNA complexes. Readers interested in a more comprehensive discussion of quinolones are referred to a previously published work (28). QUINOLONE-TOPOISOMERASE-DNA COMPLEXES As a normal part of their reaction mechanism, gyrase and topoisomerase IV introduce a pair of staggered, single-strand breaks (nicks) into DNA and become covalently bound to the 5 ends of the cleaved DNA (55, 57). Quinolones bind rapidly to enzyme-DNA complexes (35), probably before DNA cleav-age occurs (Fig. 1, step b 1); drug binding occurs with mutant gyrase (gyrA) or topoisomerase IV (parC) that fails to cleave DNA (9, 54). After drug binding, a slower, DNA cleavage-associated step occurs (35) that results in drug-mediated inhibition of religation of the DNA ends by topoisomerases (1). In a sense, quinolones trap the bacterial type II topoisomerases on DNA (17, 23, 73, 75) (Fig. 1, step b 2). The resulting structures have been termed cleavable, cleavage, and cleaved complexes. In the present study we refer to them as cleaved complexes to emphasize that phosphodiester bonds in the DNA moiety are broken (the term ternary complex is reserved for the early step in drug-enzyme-DNA complex formation in which the DNA is unbroken). A variety of quinolone-mediated phenomena follow from formation of cleaved complexes. To better understand lethal processes, we briefly describe key features of the DNA and protein components of the complexes. Since crystal structures have not been reported for cleaved complexes, tentative inferences concerning the relative positions of drug, protein, and DNA are drawn from biochemical experiments, partial structures of the bacterial topoisomerases, and complete structures of eukaryotic topoisomerase II. Evidence for the DNA being cleaved derives from the recovery of DNA fragments when cleaved complexes are treated with protein denaturants, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (Fig. 1, step g). These DNA fragments are covalently bound to the GyrA or ParC proteins (55, 57). While cleaved complexes preferentially form at particular sites on DNA (44,},

   abstract = {RecA bundles are shown to be important for the pairing of homologous loci that have segregated to opposite ends of the cell during DNA double-strand break repair in vivo in Escherichia coli. Although bacterial RecA protein functions as a filament during DNA strand exchange, early studies of RecA also noted that, in vivo, it formed bundles. These bundles were inactive in vitro, so were thought to be a way of storing RecA until it was needed. David Sherratt and colleagues now show that RecA bundles do have an important function in vivo. Super-resolution microscopy imaging shows that bundles are excluded from the bulk of the nucleoid and locate to the cell periphery where they facilitate the pairing of homologous loci that have segregated to opposite ends of the cell. After sister locus pairing, RecA bundles disassemble. DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination has evolved to maintain genetic integrity in all organisms1. Although many reactions that occur during homologous recombination are known1,2,3, it is unclear where, when and how they occur in cells. Here, by using conventional and super-resolution microscopy, we describe the progression of DSB repair in live Escherichia coli. Specifically, we investigate whether homologous recombination can occur efficiently between distant sister loci that have segregated to opposite halves of an E. coli cell. We show that a site-specific DSB in one sister can be repaired efficiently using distant sister homology. After RecBCD processing of the DSB, RecA is recruited to the cut locus, where it nucleates into a bundle that contains many more RecA molecules than can associate with the two single-stranded DNA regions that form at the DSB. Mature bundles extend along the long axis of the cell, in the space between the bulk nucleoid and the inner membrane. Bundle formation is followed by pairing, in which the two ends of the cut locus relocate at the periphery of the nucleoid and together move rapidly towards the homology of the uncut sister. After sister locus pairing, RecA bundles disassemble and proteins that act late in homologous recombination are recruited to give viable recombinants 1–2-generation-time equivalents after formation of the initial DSB. Mutated RecA proteins that do not form bundles are defective in sister pairing and in DSB-induced repair. This work reveals an unanticipated role of RecA bundles in channelling the movement of the DNA DSB ends, thereby facilitating the long-range homology search that occurs before the strand invasion and transfer reactions.},

Damaged loci rapidly mobilized after a DSB, pairing with their homologous partner to enable repair, before being resegregated to their original cellular locations, independent of DNA replication. Origin-proximal regions were resegregated by the ParABS system with the ParA structure needed for resegregation assembling dynamically in response to the DSB-induced movement of an origin-associated ParB away from one cell pole. Origin-distal regions were resegregated in a ParABS-independent manner and instead likely rely on a physical, spring-like force to segregate repaired loci. Collectively, our results provide a mechanistic basis for the resegregation of chromosomes after a DSB.},

   abstract = {We show that RecN protein is recruited to a defined DNA double strand break (DSB) in Bacillus subtilis cells at an early time point during repair. Because RecO and RecF are successively recruited to DSBs, it is now clear that dynamic DSB repair centers (RCs) exist in prokaryotes. RecA protein was also recruited to RCs and formed highly dynamic filamentous structures, which we term threads, across the nucleoids. Formation of RecA threads commenced ∼30 min after the induction of DSBs, after RecN recruitment to RCs, and disassembled after 2 h. Time-lapse microscopy showed that the threads rapidly changed in length, shape, and orientation within minutes and can extend at 1.02μm/min. The formation of RecA threads was abolished in recJ addAB mutant cells but not in each of the single mutants, suggesting that RecA filaments can be initiated via two pathways. Contrary to proteins forming RCs, DNA polymerase I did not form foci but was present throughout the nucleoids (even after induction of DSBs or after UV irradiation), suggesting that it continuously scans the chromosome for DNA lesions. © The Rockefeller University Press.},

To study the localization of RecA in live Escherichia coli cells, the RecA protein was fused to the green fluorescence protein (GFP). Strains with this gene have recombination/DNA repair activities three- to tenfold below wild type (or about 1000-fold above that of a recA null mutant). RecA-GFP cells have a background of green fluorescence punctuated with up to five foci per cell. Two types of foci have been defined: 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-sensitive foci that are bound to DNA and DAPI-insensitive foci that are DNA-less aggregates/storage structures. In log phase cells, foci were not localized to any particular region. After UV irradiation, the number of foci increased and they localized to the cell centre. This suggested colocalization with the DNA replication factory. recA, recB and recF strains showed phenotypes and distributions of foci consistent with the predicted effects of these mutations. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

UvrD is a 3′-to-5′ helicase that participates in methyl-directed mismatch repair and nucleotide excision repair. uvrD deletion mutants are sensitive to UV irradiation, hypermutable, and hyper-rec. In vitro, UvrD can dissociate RecA from single-stranded DNA. Other experiments suggest that UvrD removes RecA from DNA where it promotes unproductive reactions. To test if UvrD limits the number and/or the size of RecA-DNA structures in vivo, an uvrD mutation was combined with recA-gfp. This recA allele allows the number of RecA structures and the amount of RecA at these structures to be assayed in living cells. uvrD mutants show a threefold increase in the number of RecA-GFP foci, and these foci are, on average, nearly twofold higher in relative intensity. The increased number of RecA-green fluorescent protein foci in the uvrD mutant is dependent on recF, recO, recR, recJ, and recQ. The increase in average relative intensity is dependent on recO and recQ. These data support an in vivo role for UvrD in removing RecA from the DNA.

   abstract = {The bacterial RecBCD helicase/nuclease shows broad, and apparently static, heterogeneity in the unwinding rate manifest by individual molecules: here it is shown that transiently halting an enzyme during processive translocation allows for a change, most likely conformational, such that the velocity of the molecule after pausing can fall anywhere within the spectrum of rates seen for a population. The bacterial RecBCD helicase/nuclease shows broad heterogeneity in unwinding rates of individual molecules. Stephen Kowalczykowski and colleagues have investigated this behaviour and find that transiently stopping the enzyme during processive translocation allows for a change, probably conformational, such that the velocity of the molecule after pausing can fall anywhere within the spectrum of rates seen for a population. The interpretation is that ligand binding stabilizes a particular equilibrium conformational sub-state that can persist for the duration of unwinding of the substrates used, and that determines the rate for that molecule. Single-molecule studies can overcome the complications of asynchrony and ensemble-averaging in bulk-phase measurements, provide mechanistic insights into molecular activities, and reveal interesting variations between individual molecules1,2,3. The application of these techniques to the RecBCD helicase of Escherichia coli has resolved some long-standing discrepancies, and has provided otherwise unattainable mechanistic insights into its enzymatic behaviour4,5,6. Enigmatically, the DNA unwinding rates of individual enzyme molecules are seen to vary considerably6,7,8, but the origin of this heterogeneity remains unknown. Here we investigate the physical basis for this behaviour. Although any individual RecBCD molecule unwound DNA at a constant rate for an average of approximately 30,000 steps, we discover that transiently halting a single enzyme–DNA complex by depleting Mg2+-ATP could change the subsequent rates of DNA unwinding by that enzyme after reintroduction to ligand. The proportion of molecules that changed rate increased exponentially with the duration of the interruption, with a half-life of approximately 1 second, suggesting that a conformational change occurred during the time that the molecule was arrested. The velocity after pausing an individual molecule was any velocity found in the starting distribution of the ensemble. We suggest that substrate binding stabilizes the enzyme in one of many equilibrium conformational sub-states that determine the rate-limiting translocation behaviour of each RecBCD molecule. Each stabilized sub-state can persist for the duration (approximately 1 minute) of processive unwinding of a DNA molecule, comprising tens of thousands of catalytic steps, each of which is much faster than the time needed for the conformational change required to alter kinetic behaviour. This ligand-dependent stabilization of rate-defining conformational sub-states results in seemingly static molecule-to-molecule variation in RecBCD helicase activity, but in fact reflects one microstate from the equilibrium ensemble that a single molecule manifests during an individual processive translocation event.},

Using single-molecule fluorescence assays and hidden Markov modeling, we show the most direct evidence that a RecA filament grows and shrinks primarily one monomer at a time and only at the extremities. Both ends grow and shrink, contrary to expectation, but a higher binding rate at one end is responsible for directional filament growth. Quantitative rate determination also provides insights into how RecA might control DNA accessibility in vivo. We find that about five monomers are sufficient for filament nucleation. Although ordinarily single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) prevents filament nucleation, single RecA monomers can easily be added to an existing filament and displace SSB from DNA at the rate of filament extension.

   abstract = {Escherichia coli RecA is essential for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination1. Repair requires the formation of a RecA nucleoprotein filament. Previous studies have indicated a mechanism of filament assembly whereby slow nucleation of RecA protein on DNA is followed by rapid growth2,3,4,5,6,7. However, many aspects of this process remain unclear, including the rates of nucleation and growth and the involvement of ATP hydrolysis, largely because visualization at the single-filament level is lacking. Here we report the direct observation of filament assembly on individual double-stranded DNA molecules using fluorescently modified RecA. The nucleoprotein filaments saturate the DNA and extend it ∼1.6-fold. At early time points, discrete RecA clusters are seen, permitting analysis of single-filament growth from individual nuclei. Formation of nascent RecA filaments is independent of ATP hydrolysis but is dependent on the type of nucleotide cofactor and the RecA concentration, suggesting that nucleation involves binding of ∼4–5 ATP–RecA monomers to DNA. Individual RecA filaments grow at rates of 3–10 nm s-1. Growth is bidirectional and, in contrast to nucleation, independent of nucleotide cofactor, suggesting addition of ∼2–7 monomers s-1. These results are in accord with extensive genetic and biochemical studies, and indicate that assembly in vivo is controlled at the nucleation step. We anticipate that our approach and conclusions can be extended to the related eukaryotic counterpart, Rad51 (see ref.8), and to regulation by assembly mediators9,10,11.},

   abstract = {Fluorescent fusion proteins are exceedingly useful for monitoring protein localization in situ or visualizing protein behavior at the single molecule level. Unfortunately, some proteins are rendered inactive by the fusion. To circumvent this problem, we fused a hyperactive RecA protein (RecA803 protein) to monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP1) to produce a functional protein (RecA-RFP) that is suitable for in vivo and in vitro analysis. In vivo, the RecA-RFP partially restoresUVresistance, conjugational recombination, and SOS induction to recA- cells. In vitro, the purified RecA-RFP protein forms a nucleoprotein filament whose kcat for single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity is reduced ∼3-fold relative to wild-type protein, and which is largely inhibited by single-stranded DNA-binding protein. However, RecA protein is also a dATPase; dATP supports RecA-RFP nucleoprotein filament formation in the presence of single-stranded DNA-binding protein. Furthermore, as for the wild-type protein, the activities of RecA-RFP are further enhanced by shifting thepHto 6.2. As a consequence, RecA-RFP is proficient for DNA strand exchange with dATP or at lower pH. Finally, using single molecule visualization, RecA-RFP was seen to assemble into a continuous filament on duplex DNA, and to extend the DNA ∼1.7-fold. Consistent with its attenuated activities, RecA-RFP nucleates onto double-stranded DNA ∼3-fold more slowly than the wild-type protein, but still requires ∼3 monomers to form the rate-limited nucleus needed for filament assembly. Thus, RecA-RFP reveals that its attenuated biological functions correlate with a reduced frequency of nucleoprotein filament nucleation at the single molecule level. © 2009 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

   abstract = {The search for DNA homology is vital to recombinational DNA repair and occurs by intersegment contact sampling wherein the three-dimensional conformational state of the double-stranded DNA target and the length of the homologous RecA–single-stranded DNA filament have important roles. During DNA repair by homologous recombination, the molecule containing a double-strand break must find an undamaged, intact, exact copy of the sequence at the break to initiate a process known as strand exchange. This is facilitated by cooperative binding of a RecA family strand-exchange protein to a single-strand tail of the broken DNA. But how does the RecA–DNA filament find its matching sequence, which represents a tiny fraction of the total DNA content? In a new study, Anthony Forget and Stephen Kowalczykowski show that weak, transient contacts by the RecA–DNA filament with duplex DNA allow it to sample three-dimensional space to accelerate the recognition of homologous sequence. DNA breaks can be repaired with high fidelity by homologous recombination. A ubiquitous protein that is essential for this DNA template-directed repair is RecA1. After resection of broken DNA to produce single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), RecA assembles on this ssDNA into a filament with the unique capacity to search and find DNA sequences in double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) that are homologous to the ssDNA. This homology search is vital to recombinational DNA repair, and results in homologous pairing and exchange of DNA strands. Homologous pairing involves DNA sequence-specific target location by the RecA–ssDNA complex. Despite decades of study, the mechanism of this enigmatic search process remains unknown. RecA is a DNA-dependent ATPase, but ATP hydrolysis is not required for DNA pairing and strand exchange2,3, eliminating active search processes. Using dual optical trapping to manipulate DNA, and single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to image DNA pairing, we demonstrate that both the three-dimensional conformational state of the dsDNA target and the length of the homologous RecA–ssDNA filament have important roles in the homology search. We discovered that as the end-to-end distance of the target dsDNA molecule is increased, constraining the available three-dimensional (3D) conformations of the molecule, the rate of homologous pairing decreases. Conversely, when the length of the ssDNA in the nucleoprotein filament is increased, homology is found faster. We propose a model for the DNA homology search process termed ‘intersegmental contact sampling’, in which the intrinsic multivalent nature of the RecA nucleoprotein filament is used to search DNA sequence space within 3D domains of DNA, exploiting multiple weak contacts to rapidly search for homology. Our findings highlight the importance of the 3D conformational dynamics of DNA, reveal a previously unknown facet of the homology search, and provide insight into the mechanism of DNA target location by this member of a universal family of proteins.},

We present evidence in support of the 'sliding model' wherein a RecA filament diffuses along a dsDNA track. We further show that homology can be detected during sliding. Sliding occurs with a diffusion coefficient of approximately 8000 bp2/s allowing the filament to sample several hundred base pairs before dissociation. Modeling suggests that sliding can accelerate homology search by as much as 200 fold. Homology recognition can occur for as few as 6 nt of complementary basepairs with the recognition efficiency increasing for higher complementarity.

Furthermore, and more unexpectedly, after pausing at χ, the enzyme continues translocating but at approximately one-half the initial rate.

Single-molecule imaging techniques in live cells demonstrate that RecA is largely sequestered in storage structures during normal metabolism.

RecN is an SOS protein and a member of the Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes family of proteins thought to play a role in sister chromatid cohesion/interactions during DSBR. Previous studies have shown that a plasmid-encoded recA4190 (Q300R) mutant had a phenotype similar to DrecN (mitomycin C sensitive and UV resistant). It was hypothesized that RecN and RecA physically interact, and that recA4190 specifically eliminated this interaction. To test this model, an epistasis analysis between recA4190 and DrecN was performed in wild-type and recBC sbcBC cells. To do this, recA4190 was first transferred to the chromosome. As single mutants, recA4190 and DrecN were Rec+ as measured by transductional recombination, but were 3-fold and 10-fold decreased in their ability to do I-SceIinduced DSBR, respectively. In both cases, the double mutant had an additive phenotype relative to either single mutant. In the recBC sbcBC background, recA4190 and DrecN cells were very UVS (sensitive), Rec2, had high basal levels of SOS expression and an altered distribution of RecA-GFP structures. In all cases, the double mutant had additive phenotypes.

   abstract = {Efficient DNA repair is crucial for maintaining genome integrity and ensuring cell survival. In Escherichia coli , RecBCD plays a crucial role in processing DNA ends following a DNA double-strand break (DSB) to initiate repair by homologous recombination. While RecBCD has been extensively studied in vitro , less is known about how it contributes to rapid and efficient repair in living bacteria. Here, we perform single-molecule microscopy to investigate DNA repair in real-time in E. coli . We quantify RecB single-molecule mobility and monitor the induction of the DNA damage response (SOS response) in individual cells. We show that RecB binding to broken DNA ends leads to efficient repair without SOS induction. In contrast, in a RecB mutant with modified activities leading to the activation of an alternative repair pathway, repair is less efficient and leads to high SOS induction. Our findings reveal how subtle alterations in RecB activity profoundly impact the efficiency of DNA repair in E. coli .

   abstract = {The presence of an abnormal amount of single-stranded DNA in the bacterial cell constitutes a genotoxic alarm signal that induces the SOS response, a broad regulatory network found in most bacterial species to address DNA damage. The aim of this review was to point out that beyond being a repair process, SOS induction leads to a very strong but transient response to genotoxic stress, during which bacteria can rearrange and mutate their genome, induce several phenotypic changes through differential regulation of genes, and sometimes acquire characteristics that potentiate bacterial survival and adaptation to changing environments. We review here the causes and consequences of SOS induction, but also how this response can be modulated under various circumstances and how it is connected to the network of other important stress responses. In the first section, we review articles describing the induction of the SOS response at the molecular level. The second section discusses consequences of this induction in terms of DNA repair, changes in the genome and gene expression, and sharing of genomic information, with their effects on the bacteria's life and evolution. The third section is about the fine tuning of this response to fit with the bacteria's 'needs'. Finally, we discuss recent findings linking the SOS response to other stress responses. Under these perspectives, SOS can be perceived as a powerful bacterial strategy against aggressions.},

   abstract = {Bacteria can rapidly evolve resistance to antibiotics via the SOS response, a state of high-activity DNA repair and mutagenesis. We explore here the first steps of this evolution in the bacterium Escherichia coli. Induction of the SOS response by the genotoxic antibiotic ciprofloxacin changes the E. coli rod shape into multichromosome-containing filaments. We show that at subminimal inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin the bacterial filament divides asymmetrically repeatedly at the tip. Chromosome-containing buds are made that, if resistant, propagate nonfilamenting progeny with enhanced resistance to ciprofloxacin as the parent filament dies. We propose that the multinucleated filament creates an environmental niche where evolution can proceed via generation of improved mutant chromosomes due to the mutagenic SOS response and possible recombination of the new alleles between chromosomes. Our data provide a better understanding of the processes underlying the origin of resistance at the single-cell level and suggest an analogous role to the eukaryotic aneuploidy condition in cancer.},

Our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art self-supervised blind denoising algorithms, on six publicly available biomedical image datasets. We also show empirically with synthetic noisy data that our model captures the noise distribution efficiently.

For a single position, single channel with 1,000 frames (2-GB dataset), image processing takes ~6 min on a regular computer.

We report experiments which address the mechanism of this inhibition. The introduction of the recombination-stimulating sequence chi into one such clone allows growth of this phage on Rec+ cells. In addition, the insertion of λ gam+ gene into a rec+ -inhibited clone results in the ability of the phage to form plaques on wild-type cells. Since λ Gam protein is an inhibitor of host RecBC enzyme, we tested a collection of such phage for growth on a variety of hosts altered in RecBC function. Host permissiveness correlated with the inactivation of the RecBC nucleolytic activities and not with the recombinational activities. These observations suggest that the inserted DNA sequences of these phage limit the production of packageable chromosomes. This conclusion is easily reconciled with our current knowledge of the interaction of the host recombination systems with λ replication and encapsidation. Based on these experiments we have constructed strains, both recombination-proficient and recombination-deficient, which serve as improved hosts for the recovery of genomic sequences which are otherwise inhibitory to the growth of phage L. © 1986.},

We propose that recA+, recB+, recC+ gene products are involved in repair of DNA chain breaks that arise during cell growth. According to this view, mutation in the rec genes results in defective repair. This may lead to failure to replicate DNA, loss of viability, degradation of the DNA in the case of the recA- strain, and accumulation of DNA chain breaks in the recA-recB-recC- strain. © 1978.},

A critically important molecular mechanism is genetic recombination, required for the beneficial reassortment of genetic information and for DNA double-strand break repair (DSBR). Central to recombination is the RecA (Rad51) protein that assembles into a spiral filament on DNA and mediates genetic exchange. Here we have developed a method that combines chromatin immunoprecipitation with next-generation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and mathematical modeling to quantify RecA protein binding during the active repair of a single DSB in the chromosome of Escherichia coli. We have used quantitative genomic analysis to infer the key in vivo molecular parameters governing RecA loading by the helicase/ nuclease RecBCD at recombination hot-spots, known as Chi. Our genomic analysis has also revealed that DSBR at the lacZ locus causes a second RecBCD-mediated DSBR event to occur in the terminus region of the chromosome, over 1 Mb away.},

However, the complex photophysics of these genetically encoded markers complicates the quantitative analysis of PALM data. Here, we show that intense 561 nm light (∼1 kW/cm2) typically used to localize single red molecules considerably affects the green-state photophysics of mEos2 by populating at least two reversible dark states. These dark states retard green-to-red photoconversion through a shelving effect, although one of them is rapidly depopulated by 405 nm light illumination. Multiple mEos2 switching and irreversible photobleaching is thus induced by yellow/green and violet photons before green-to-red photoconversion occurs, contributing to explain the apparent limited signaling efficiency of this PCFP. Our data reveals that the photophysics of PCFPs of anthozoan origin is substantially more complex than previously thought, and suggests that intense 561 nm laser light should be used with care, notably for quantitative or fast PALM approaches.},

Intracellular labeling using these techniques requires cell-permeable fluorescent ligands, however, limiting utility to a small number of classic fluorophores.

Inspired by molecular modeling, we replaced the N,N-dimethylamino substituents in tetramethylrhodamine with four-membered azetidine rings. This addition of two carbon atoms doubles the quantum efficiency and improves the photon yield of the dye in applications ranging from in vitro single-molecule measurements to super-resolution imaging.

In bacteria, several different DNA lesions are repaired by homologous recombination, a process that involves sister chromatid pairing. Previous work in Escherichia coli has demonstrated that sister chromatid interactions (SCIs) mediated by topological links termed precatenanes, are controlled by topoisomerase IV. In the present work, we demonstrate that during the repair of mitomycin C-induced lesions, topological links are rapidly substituted by an SOS-induced sister chromatid cohesion process involving the RecN protein. The loss of SCIs and viability defects observed in the absence of RecN were compensated by alterations in topoisomerase IV, suggesting that the main role of RecN during DNA repair is to promote contacts between sister chromatids. RecN also modulates whole chromosome organization and RecA dynamics suggesting that SCIs significantly contribute to the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Homologous recombination of DNA lesions in bacteria involves sister chromatid pairing. Here, the authors show that RecN promotes contacts between sister chromatids and facilitates repair.},

Here we show that the purified Escherichia coli RecN protein topologically loads onto both single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) that has a preference for ssDNA. RecN topologically bound to dsDNA slides off the end of linear dsDNA, but this is prevented by RecA nucleoprotein filaments on ssDNA, thereby allowing RecN to translocate to DSBs. Furthermore, we found that, once RecN is recruited onto ssDNA, it can topologically capture a second dsDNA substrate in an ATP-dependent manner, suggesting a role in synapsis. Indeed, RecN stimulates RecA-mediated D-loop formation and subsequent strand exchange activities. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the recruitment of RecN to DSBs and sister chromatid interactions by RecN, both of which function in RecA-mediated DSB repair. Kenji Keyamura and Takashi Hishida demonstrate that RecN binds to single-stranded and double-stranded DNA through topological entrapment and stimulates RecA-mediated strand exchange activity in bacteria.
