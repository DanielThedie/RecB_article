   abstract = {Cell biology is increasingly dependent on quantitative methods resulting in the need for microscopic labelling technologies that are highly sensitive and specific. Whilst the use of fluorescent proteins has led to major advances, they also suffer from their relatively low brightness and photo-stability, making the detection of very low abundance proteins using fluorescent protein-based methods challenging. Here, we characterize the use of the self-labelling protein tag called HaloTag, in conjunction with an organic fluorescent dye, to label and accurately count endogenous proteins present in very low numbers (<7) in individual Escherichia coli cells. This procedure can be used to detect single molecules in fixed cells with conventional epifluorescence illumination and a standard microscope. We show that the detection efficiency of proteins labelled with the HaloTag is ≥80%, which is on par or better than previous techniques. Therefore, this method offers a simple and attractive alternative to current procedures to detect low abundance molecules.},

A fusion protein of a fast-maturing yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and a membrane-targeting peptide was expressed under a repressed condition. The membrane-localized YFP can be detected with single-molecule sensitivity. We found that the protein molecules are produced in bursts, with each burst originating from a stochastically transcribed single messenger RNA molecule, and that protein copy numbers in the bursts follow a geometric distribution.

Initially, the RecBCD complex2 resects the ends of the DSB into 3′ single-stranded DNA on which a RecA filament assembles3. Next, the filament locates the homologous repair template on the sister chromosome4. Here we directly visualize the repair of DSBs in single cells, using high-throughput microfluidics and fluorescence microscopy. We find that, in Escherichia coli, repair of DSBs between segregated sister loci is completed in 15 ± 5 min (mean ± s.d.)&nbsp;with minimal fitness loss. We further show that the search takes less than 9 ± 3 min (mean&nbsp;±&nbsp;s.d)&nbsp;and is mediated by a thin, highly dynamic RecA filament that stretches throughout the cell. We propose that the architecture of the RecA filament effectively reduces search dimensionality. This model predicts a search time that is consistent with our measurement and is corroborated by the observation that the search time does not depend on the length of the cell or the amount of DNA. Given the abundance of RecA homologues5, we believe this model to be&nbsp;widely conserved across living organisms. Observations of rapid repair of double-stranded DNA breaks in sister choromosomes in Escherichia coli are consistent with a reduced-dimensionality-search model of RecA-mediated repair.},

@article{Sinha2018,
   abstract = {It was recently reported that the recBC mutants of Escherichia coli, deficient for DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, have a decreased copy number of their terminus region. We previously showed that this deficit resulted from DNA loss after post-replicative breakage of one of the two sister-chromosome termini at cell division. A viable cell and a dead cell devoid of terminus region were thus produced and, intriguingly, the reaction was transmitted to the following generations. Using genome marker frequency profiling and observation by microscopy of specific DNA loci within the terminus, we reveal here the origin of this phenomenon. We observed that terminus DNA loss was reduced in a recA mutant by the double-strand DNA degradation activity of RecBCD. The terminus-less cell produced at the first cell division was less prone to divide than the one produced at the next generation. DNA loss was not heritable if the chromosome was linearized in the terminus and occurred at chromosome termini that were unable to segregate after replication. We propose that in a recB mutant replication fork breakage results in the persistence of a linear DNA tail attached to a circular chromosome. Segregation of the linear and circular parts of this “σ-replicating chromosome” causes terminus DNA breakage during cell division. One daughter cell inherits a truncated linear chromosome and is not viable. The other inherits a circular chromosome attached to a linear tail ending in the chromosome terminus. Replication extends this tail, while degradation of its extremity results in terminus DNA loss. Repeated generation and segregation of new σ-replicating chromosomes explains the heritability of post-replicative breakage. Our results allow us to determine that in E. coli at each generation, 18% of cells are subject to replication fork breakage at dispersed, potentially random, chromosomal locations.},

To counteract the latter activity, bacteriophage λ encodes a small protein inhibitor called Gam that binds to RecBCD and inactivates the complex. Here, we show that Gam inhibits RecBCD by competing at the DNA-binding site. The interaction surface is extensive and involves molecular mimicry of the DNA substrate. We also show that expression of Gam in E. coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae increases sensitivity to fluoroquinolones; antibacterials that kill cells by inhibiting topoisomerases and inducing double-stranded DNA breaks. Furthermore, fluoroquinolone-resistance in K. pneumoniae clinical isolates is reversed by expression of Gam. Together, our data explain the synthetic lethality observed between topoisomerase-induced DNA breaks and the RecBCD gene products, suggesting a new co-antibacterial strategy.},

Upon induction of the SOS response by a low dose of UV irradiation an extensive reorganization of the nucleoids occurred. Two distinct phases were observed by fluorescence microscopy. First, the nucleoids were found to change shape and fuse into compact structures at midcell. The compaction of the nucleoids lasted for 10-20 min and was followed by a phase where the DNA was dispersed throughout the cells. This second phase lasted for ~1 h. The compaction was found to be dependent on the recombination proteins RecA, RecO and RecR as well as the SOS-inducible, SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes)- like protein RecN. RecN protein is produced in high amounts during the first part of the SOS response. It is possible that the RecN-mediated 'compact DNA' stage at the beginning of the SOS response serves to stabilize damaged DNA prior to recombination and repair. © 2014 The Authors.},

   abstract = {The recombinational hot spot X modulates the nuclease and helicase activities of the RecBCD enzyme, leading to generation of an early DNA intermediate for homologous recombination. Here we identify the subunit location of the nuclease active site in RecBCD. The isolated RecB protein cleaves circular single-stranded M13 phage DNA, but RecB1-929, comprising only the 100 kDa N-terminal domain of RecB, does not. We reported previously that the reconstituted RecB1-929CD enzyme also is not a nuclease, suggesting that the C-terminal 30 kDa domain of RecB is a non-specific ssDNA endonuclease. However, we were unable to detect nuclease activity with the subtilisin-generated C-terminal 30 kDa fragment of RecB. Since the subtilisin-generated fragment did not bind to a ssDNA-agarose column, we designed a chimeric enzyme by attaching the C-terminal 30 kDa domain of RecB to the gene 32 protein of T4 phage, a ssDNA binding protein that does not have strand scission ability. In addition, Asp427 in the chimeric enzyme (Asp1080 in RecB), a residue that is conserved among several RecB homologs, was substituted to alanine (the D427A mutant). The wild-type chimeric enzyme cleaves the M13 DNA and the D427A mutation abolishes the endonuclease activity of the chimeric enzyme but does not affect its DNA binding ability. This finding indicates an unusual bipartite nature in the structural organization of RecB, in which the DNA-binding function is located in the N-terminal 100 kDa domain and the nuclease catalytic domain is located in the C-terminal 30 kDa domain. The purified RecB(D1080A)CD mutant is a processive helicase but not a nuclease, demonstrating that RecBCD has a single nuclease active site in the C terminal 30 kDa domain of RecB.},

   abstract = {The RecA loading activity of the RecBCD enzyme, together with its helicase and 5′ → 3′ exonuclease activities, is essential for recombination in Escherichia coli. One particular mutant in the nuclease catalytic center of RecB, i.e., recB1080, produces an enzyme that does not have nuclease activity and is unable to load RecA protein onto single-stranded DNA. There are, however, previously published contradictory data on the recombination proficiency of this mutant. In a recF- background the recB1080 mutant is recombination deficient, whereas in a recF+ genetic background it is recombination proficient. A possible explanation for these contrasting phenotypes may be that the RecFOR system promotes RecA-single-strand DNA filament formation and replaces the RecA loading defect of the RecB1080CD enzyme. We tested this hypothesis by using three in vivo assays. We compared the recombination proficiencies of recB1080, rec0, recR, and RecF single mutants and recB1080 rec0, recB1080 recR, and recB1080 recF double mutants. We show that RecFOR functions rescue the repair and recombination deficiency of the recB1080 mutant and that RecA loading is independent of RecFOR in the recB1080 recD double mutant where this activity is provided by the RecB1080C(D-) enzyme. According to our results as well as previous data, three essential activities for the initiation of recombination in the recB1080 mutant are provided by different proteins, i.e., helicase activity by RecB1080CD, 5′ → 3′ exonuclease by RecJ- and RecA-single-stranded DNA filament formation by RecFOR.},

Interaction with Chi causes an attenuation of the RecBCD enzyme's vigorous nuclease activity, switches the polarity of the attenuated nuclease activity to the 5' strand, changes the operation of its motor subunits, and instructs the enzyme to begin loading the RecA protein onto the resultant Chi-containing single-stranded DNA. This enzyme is a prototypical example of a molecular machine: the protein architecture incorporates several autonomous functional domains that interact with each other to produce a complex, sequence-regulated, DNA-processing machine.

Here, we develop a two-color fluorescent reporter to directly observe the resection of individual inducible DSB sites within live E. coli cells. Realtime imaging shows that RecBCD during end resection degrades DNA with remarkably high speed (i"1.6 kb/s) and high processivity (>7sim;100 kb). The results show a pronounced asymmetry in the processing of the two DNA ends of a DSB, where much longer stretches of DNA are degraded in the direction of terminus. The microscopy observations are confirmed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction measurements of the DNA degradation. Deletion of the recD gene drastically decreased the length of resection, allowing for recombination with short ectopic plasmid homologies and significantly increasing the efficiency of horizontal gene transfer between strains.We thus visualized and quantified DNA end resection by the RecBCD complex in live cells, recorded DNA-degradation linked to end resection and uncovered a general relationship between the length of end resection and the choice of the homologous recombination template.},

We propose that this domain harbors a site that interacts with RecA protein, recruiting it to single-stranded DNA during unwinding.

   abstract = {We report here an unusual mechanism for enzyme regulation: the disassembly of all three subunits of RecBCD enzyme after its interaction with a Chi recombination hot spot. The enzyme, which is essential for the major pathway of recombination in Escherichia coli, acts on linear double-stranded DNA bearing a Chi site to produce single-stranded DNA substrates for strand exchange by RecA protein. We show that after reaction with DNA bearing Chi sites, RecBCD enzyme is inactivated and the three subunits migrate as separate species during glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation or native gel electrophoresis. This Chi-mediated inactivation and disassembly of purified RecBCD enzyme can account for the previously reported Chi-dependent loss of Chi activity in E. coli cells containing broken DNA. Our results support a model of recombination in which Chi regulates one RecBCD enzyme molecule to make a single recombinational exchange ('one enzyme-one exchange' hypothesis).},

We studied the mechanism of DSB formation by direct measure of the amount of in vivo linear DNA in Escherichia coli cells that lack the RecBCD recombination complex and by genetic means. The RuvABC proteins, which catalyze migration and cleavage of Holliday junctions, are responsible for the occurrence of DSBs at arrested replication forks. In cells proficient for RecBC, RuvAB is uncoupled from RuvC and DSBs may be prevented. This may be explained if a Holliday junction forms upon replication fork arrest, by annealing of the two nascent strands.

   abstract = {Chromosomal replication is the major source of spontaneous DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in living cells. Repair of these DSBs is essential for cell viability, and accuracy of repair is critical to avoid chromosomal rearrangements. Repair of replication-dependent DSBs occurs primarily by homologous recombination with a sister chromosome. However, this reaction has never been visualized at a defined chromosomal locus, so little is known about its spatial or temporal dynamics. Repair of a replication-independent DSB generated in Escherichia coli by a rare-cutting endonuclease leads to the formation of a bundle of RecA filaments. In this study, we show that in contrast, repair of a replication-dependent DSB involves a transient RecA focus localized in the central region of the cell in which the DNA is replicated. The recombining loci remain centrally located with restricted movement before segregating with little extension to the period of postreplicative sister-chromosome cohesion. The spatial and temporal efficiency of this reaction is remarkable.},

   abstract = {Abstract— Degradation of the DNA of a rec‐ mutant of Escherichia coli K12 (JC1569 b) induced by u.v. light was investigated. The rate of degradation was much larger by growing bacteria than by stationary cells. When growing bacteria were starved for amino acids, their DNA became resistant to irradiation. The mode of u.v.‐induced degradation was investigated by comparing the time course of release from the acid‐insoluble fraction of the label for two growing cultures; the one was pulse‐labeled with 3H‐thymidine and the other was pulse‐labeled and chased thereafter for 12 min. It was found that the label incorporated into the former culture begins to be lost from the acid‐insoluble fraction prior to the loss of the label incorporated into the latter culture. It was concluded that breakdown of the replicating point precedes degradation of the bulk of the DNA. This result suggested that the replicating point is a sensitive site to irradiation and the u.v.‐induced degradation of DNA seemed to be influenced by the state of chromosome at the time of irradiation. Experiments of centrifugation of lysed spheroplasts of bacteria uniformly labeled with 3H‐thymidine in alkaline sucrose demonstrated that DNA of low molecular weight appeared after irradiation with only 5 ergs/ mm2, and that the molecular weight could not be restored by post‐irradiation incubation. Considering these results, an hypothesis is proposed concerning the initiation of induced degradation of the DNA of the rec‐ mutant. Copyright © 1968, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

Res. 168, 499–506 (2007).After UV irradiation, recA mutants fail to recover replication, and a dramatic and nearly complete degradation of the genomic DNA occurs. Although the RecBCD helicase/nuclease complex is known to mediate this catastrophic DNA degradation, it is not known how or where this degradation is initiated. Previous studies have speculated that RecBCD targets and initiates degradation from the nascent DNA at replication forks arrested by DNA damage. To test this question, we examined which enzymes were responsible for the degradation of genomic DNA and the nascent DNA in UV-irradiated recA cells. We show here that, although RecBCD degrades the genomic DNA after UV irradiation, it does not target the nascent DNA at arrested replication forks. Instead, we observed that the nascent DNA at arrested replication forks in recA cultures is degraded by RecJ/RecQ, similar to what occurs in wild-type cultures. These findings indicate that the genomic DNA degradation and nascent DNA degradation in UV-irradiated recA mutants are mediated separately through RecBCD and RecJ/RecQ, respectively. In addition, they demonstrate that RecBCD initiates degradation at a site(s) other than the arrested replication fork directly.},

   abstract = {The RecBCD enzyme of Escherichia coli is an ATP-dependent DNA exonuclease and a helicase. Its exonuclease activity is subject to regulation by an octameric nucleotide sequence called χ. In this study, site-directed mutations were made in the carboxyl-terminal nuclease domain of the RecB subunit, and their effects on RecBCD's enzymatic activities were investigated. Mutation of two amino acid residues, Asp1067 and Lys1082, abolished nuclease activity on both single- and double-stranded DNA. Together with Asp1080, these residues compose a motif that is similar to one shown to form the active site of several restriction endonucleases. The nuclease reactions catalyzed by the RecBCD enzyme should therefore follow the same mechanism as these restriction endonucleases. Furthermore, the mutant enzymes were unable to produce χ-specific fragments that are thought to result from the 3'-5' and 5'-3' single-stranded exonuclease activities of the enzyme during its reaction with χ-containing double-stranded DNA. The results show that the nuclease active site in the RecB C-terminal 30-kDa domain is the universal nuclease active site of RecBCD that is responsible for DNA degradation in both directions during the reaction with double-stranded DNA. A novel explanation for the observed nuclease polarity switch and RecBCD-DNA interaction is offered.},

   abstract = {Homologous recombination and double-stranded DNA break repair in Escherichia coli are initiated by the multifunctional RecBCD enzyme. After binding to a double-stranded DNA end, the RecBCD enzyme unwinds and degrades the DNA processively. This processing is regulated by the recombination hot spot, Chi (χ: 5'-GCTGGTGG-3'), which induces a switch in the polarity of DNA degradation and activates RecBCD enzyme to coordinate the loading of the DNA strand exchange protein, RecA, onto the single-stranded DNA products of unwinding. Recently, a single mutation in RecB, Asp-1080 → Ala, was shown to create an enzyme (RecB(D1080A)CD) that is a processive helicase but not a nuclease. Here we show that the RecB(D1080A)CD enzyme is also unable to coordinate the loading of the RecA protein, regardless of whether χ sites are present in the DNA. However, the RecB(D1080A)CD enzyme does respond to χ sites by inactivating in a χ-dependent manner. These data define a locus of the RecBCD enzyme that is essential not only for nuclease function but also for the coordination of RecA protein loading.},

By combining genetic, biochemical, and molecular biology approaches, we demonstrate that exonuclease VII (ExoVII) excises quinolone-induced trapped DNA gyrase, an essential prokaryotic type IIA topoisomerase. We show that ExoVII repairs trapped type IIA TOPcc and that ExoVII displays tyrosyl nuclease activity for the tyrosyl-DNA linkage on the 5′-DNA overhangs corresponding to trapped type IIA TOPcc. ExoVII-deficient bacteria fail to remove trapped DNA gyrase, consistent with their hypersensitivity to quinolones. We also identify an ExoVII inhibitor that synergizes with the antimicrobial activity of quinolones, including in quinolone-resistant bacterial strains, further demonstrating the functional importance of ExoVII for the repair of type IIA TOPcc.},

   abstract = {Quinolone drugs can inhibit bacterial DNA replication, via interaction with the type II topoisomerase DNA gyrase. Using a DNA template containing a preferred site for quinolone-induced gyrase cleavage, we have demonstrated that the passage of the bacteriophage T7 replication complex is blocked in vitro by the formation of a gyrase-drug-DNA complex. The majority of the polymerase is arrested approximately 10 bp upstream of this preferred site, although other minor sites of blocking have been observed. The ability of mutant gyrase proteins to arrest DNA replication in vitro has been investigated. Gyrase containing mutations in the A subunit at either the active-site tyrosine (Tyr122) or Ser83 (a residue known to be involved in quinolone interaction) failed to halt the progress of the polymerase. A low-level, quinolone-resistant mutation in the B subunit of gyrase showed reduced blocking compared to wild-type. We have demonstrated that DNA cleavage and replication blocking occur on similar time-scales and we conclude that formation of the cleavable complex is a prerequisite for polymerase blocking. Additionally, we have shown that collision of the replication proteins with the gyrase-drug-DNA complex is not sufficient to render this complex irreversible and that further factors must be involved in processing this stalled complex. © 2000 Academic Press.},

   abstract = {The fluoroquinolones are broad-spectrum antibacterial agents that are becoming increasingly popular as bacterial resistance erodes the effectiveness of other agents (fluoroquin-olone sales accounted for 18% of the antibacterial market in 2006) (41). One of the attractive features of the quinolones is their ability to kill bacteria rapidly, an ability that differs widely among the various derivatives. For example, quinolones differ in rate and extent of killing, in the need for aerobic metabolism to kill cells, and in the effect of protein synthesis inhibitors on quinolone lethality. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these differences could lead to new ways for identifying the most bactericidal quinolone derivatives. Before describing the types of damage caused by the quin-olones, it is useful to define lethal activity. Operationally, it is the ability of drug treatment to reduce the number of viable cells, usually measured as CFU on drug-free agar after treatment. This assay is distinct from measurements that detect inhibition of growth (e.g., MIC), since with the latter bacteria are exposed to drug throughout the measurement. The distinction between killing and blocking growth is important because it allows susceptibility determinations to be related to particular biological processes. For example, inhibition of growth is typically reversed by the removal of drug, while cell death is not. Thus, biochemical events associated with blocking growth should be readily reversible, while those responsible for cell death should be difficult to reverse. Reversibility can be used to distinguish among quinolone derivatives and assign functions to particular aspects of drug structure. Moreover, protective functions, such as repair and stress responses, can be distinguished by whether their absence affects inhibition of growth, killing, or both. The intracellular targets of the quinolones are two DNA topoisomerases: gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Gyrase tends to be the primary target in gram-negative bacteria, while topo-isomerase IV is preferentially inhibited by most quinolones in gram-positive organisms (28). Both enzymes use a double-strand DNA passage mechanism, and it is likely that quinolone biochemistry is similar for both. However, physiological differences between the enzymes exist, some of which may bear on quinolone lethality. In the present minireview we consider cell death through a two-part "poison" hypothesis in which the quinolones form reversible drug-topoisomerase-DNA complexes that subsequently lead to several types of irreversible (lethal) damage. Other consequences of quinolone treatment, such as depletion of gyrase and topoisomerase IV activity, are probably less immediate (42). To provide a framework for considering quin-olone lethality, we begin by briefly describing the drug-topo-isomerase-DNA complexes. Readers interested in a more comprehensive discussion of quinolones are referred to a previously published work (28). QUINOLONE-TOPOISOMERASE-DNA COMPLEXES As a normal part of their reaction mechanism, gyrase and topoisomerase IV introduce a pair of staggered, single-strand breaks (nicks) into DNA and become covalently bound to the 5 ends of the cleaved DNA (55, 57). Quinolones bind rapidly to enzyme-DNA complexes (35), probably before DNA cleav-age occurs (Fig. 1, step b 1); drug binding occurs with mutant gyrase (gyrA) or topoisomerase IV (parC) that fails to cleave DNA (9, 54). After drug binding, a slower, DNA cleavage-associated step occurs (35) that results in drug-mediated inhibition of religation of the DNA ends by topoisomerases (1). In a sense, quinolones trap the bacterial type II topoisomerases on DNA (17, 23, 73, 75) (Fig. 1, step b 2). The resulting structures have been termed cleavable, cleavage, and cleaved complexes. In the present study we refer to them as cleaved complexes to emphasize that phosphodiester bonds in the DNA moiety are broken (the term ternary complex is reserved for the early step in drug-enzyme-DNA complex formation in which the DNA is unbroken). A variety of quinolone-mediated phenomena follow from formation of cleaved complexes. To better understand lethal processes, we briefly describe key features of the DNA and protein components of the complexes. Since crystal structures have not been reported for cleaved complexes, tentative inferences concerning the relative positions of drug, protein, and DNA are drawn from biochemical experiments, partial structures of the bacterial topoisomerases, and complete structures of eukaryotic topoisomerase II. Evidence for the DNA being cleaved derives from the recovery of DNA fragments when cleaved complexes are treated with protein denaturants, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (Fig. 1, step g). These DNA fragments are covalently bound to the GyrA or ParC proteins (55, 57). While cleaved complexes preferentially form at particular sites on DNA (44,},
