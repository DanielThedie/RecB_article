\section{JF549 dye photobleaching kinetics}
\label{note:dye_bleaching} 

In our approach to estimating RecB binding times to DNA, the photostability of the fluorescent dye was of primary concern. Since we detect single molecules of RecB bound to DNA, two main photophysical behaviours were liable to cause artefacts in our data:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Photobleaching (an irreversible loss of fluorescence) would limit the maximum number of frames we can track a DNA-bound RecB for, and would artefactually reduce the fitted binding times since some fluorescent spots might disappear due to photobleaching rather than unbinding from DNA
    \item Blinking (a transient loss of fluorescence) could cause repeated disappearance and reappearance of single molecules, and hence bias the computed binding times
\end{enumerate}

To address these concerns, we computed ensemble-level photobleaching curves by integrating the total fluorescence signal from the cells (Supp. Fig. \ref{SIFig:dye_bleaching}A). After 50 frames of laser exposure, a significant amount of photobleaching was noticeable (27\% $\pm$ 9 of the initial fluorescence remaining). The exact photobleaching rate of the dye in our experimental conditions can be estimated by fitting the photobleaching curve with an exponential decay function of the form $y=a.e^{-k.t}+b$ (with a the amplitude of the fit, k the bleaching rate, and b an offset to account for cellular auto-fluorescence). Since the bleaching rate is expected to mostly depend on experimental parameters that vary between but not within datasets (output laser power, HiLo angle), one bleaching rate was computed per dataset (Supp. Fig. \ref{SIFig:dye_bleaching}B). The true RecB dissociation rates were computed by subtracting the corresponding bleaching rates from the fitted spot disappearance rates.

All experimental photobleaching curves were well-fitted by a mono-exponential decay function. If significant blinking of the dye was occurring, we would expect photobleaching curves to follow more complex kinetics.\cite{} We therefore concluded that in our experimental conditions, the JF549 dye was not experiencing blinking, consistent with previous reports of the dye's outstanding photostability.\cite{}

\section{Formation of RecB spots by the freely diffusing RecBCD-Halo-Gam complex}
\label{note:spurious_spots}
% Question: why are we seeing short-lived RecB spots when Gam prevents DNA binding?
In cells that overexpress the Gam protein, RecB is expected to be unable to bind DNA. Even though Gam overexpression prevents the apparition of long-lived RecB spots under exposure to ciprofloxacin, short-lived RecB spots remain present (Figure \ref{Fig:lifetime_fits}C). To understand how RecB spots can be formed in the absence of DNA binding, we simulated the expected displacements of a RecBCD-Halo-Gam complex according to the distribution of single displacements for a random 2D walk:
\begin{equation}
    P(r) = \dfrac{r}{2D_i t}e^{-\dfrac{r^2}{4D_i t}}
\end{equation}

with $D_i$ the apparent diffusion coefficient, and $t$ the frame time. Our previous work found a diffusion coefficient for RecB-Halo of $\sim$1.5 \ums. Assuming that the diffusion coefficient is proportional to the cube of the molecular weight, we expect a diffusion coefficient for the full RecBCD-Halo-Gam complex of $\sim$1 \ums. The frame time in our experiments is 1 second, but it is likely that a molecule that would stay immobile for a fraction of that time would still be visible as a spot. Although calculating a precise value is challenging, we used a ballpark estimate of 500 ms (half our frame time) of a molecule being immobile to be detected as a spot in our experiment. Supp. Figure \ref{SIFig:displacement_simul} shows the distribution of expected displacements under these parameters. Although most displacements would be too big to result in a bright fluorescent spot, a small fraction ($\sim$4\%) are smaller than 300 nm, and could create a spot. When factoring in the number of RecB molecules per cell (5 on average) and the number of frames in our timelapse (50), this would result in $\sim$10 RecB spots per cell, on the same order of magnitude as the number of spots observed in our experiments in the presence of the Gam protein (4.1 $\pm$ 0.2, mean $\pm$ sem).
