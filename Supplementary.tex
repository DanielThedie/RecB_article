\section{JF549 dye photobleaching kinetics}
\label{note:dye_bleaching} 

In our approach to estimating RecB binding times to DNA, the photostability of the fluorescent dye was of primary concern. Since we detect single molecules of RecB bound to DNA, two main photophysical behaviours were liable to cause artefacts in our data:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Photobleaching (an irreversible loss of fluorescence) would limit the maximum number of frames we can track a DNA-bound RecB for, and would artefactually reduce the fitted binding times since some fluorescent spots might disappear due to photobleaching rather than unbinding from DNA
    \item Blinking (a transient loss of fluorescence) could cause repeated disappearance and reappearance of single molecules, and hence bias the computed binding times
\end{enumerate}

To address these concerns, we computed ensemble-level photobleaching curves by integrating the total fluorescence signal from the cells (Supp. Fig. \ref{SIFig:dye_bleaching}A). After 50 frames of laser exposure, a significant amount of photobleaching was noticeable (27\% $\pm$ 9 of the initial fluorescence remaining). The exact photobleaching rate of the dye in our experimental conditions can be estimated by fitting the photobleaching curve with an exponential decay function of the form $y=a.e^{-k.t}+b$ (with a the amplitude of the fit, k the bleaching rate, and b an offset to account for cellular auto-fluorescence). Since the bleaching rate is expected to mostly depend on experimental parameters that vary between but not within datasets (output laser power, HiLo angle), one bleaching rate was computed per dataset (Supp. Fig. \ref{SIFig:dye_bleaching}B). The true RecB dissociation rates were computed by subtracting the corresponding bleaching rates from the fitted spot disappearance rates.

All experimental photobleaching curves were well-fitted by a mono-exponential decay function. If significant blinking of the dye was occurring, we would expect photobleaching curves to follow more complex kinetics.\cite{} We therefore concluded that in our experimental conditions, the JF549 dye was not experiencing blinking, consistent with previous reports of the dye's outstanding photostability.\cite{}
