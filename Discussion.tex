\subsection*{RecB dissociation does not depend on subsequent repair steps}
In this work, we used imaging of RecB bound to DSBs to elucidate key aspects of RecBCD's processing of DSBs in vivo, focussing on how long RecBCD remains bound to DNA after DSB recognition and whether this binding time depends on the level of DNA damage. We found that in wild-type \ecoli, RecB stays bound to DSBs for 10 to 15 seconds on average (Table \ref{tab:fit_results}), independently of the concentration of ciprofloxacin. Additionally, we investigated whether RecA might play a role in promoting RecBCD dissociation from DNA. Imaging RecB in a \dreca\ mutant indicated that this is not the case, and that RecB dissociation occurs independently of RecA loading (Table \ref{tab:fit_mutants}). Interestingly, the \geneteneighty\ mutant had a reduced dissociation rate compared to wild-type cells, which highlights the importance of RecB's exonuclease activity in the process and the possibility that digestion of the unwound DNA strands is a pre-requisite for RecBCD dissociation.

\subsection*{RecB can be used as a marker to quantify DSB formation \emph{in vivo}}
Given RecBCD's high affinity for DSBs \emph{in vivo} and our ability to detect its binding to DSBs, the system is a useful tool to detect the presence of DSBs in \ecoli. Our experiments allowed us to estimate the number of recruitment of RecB to DSBs per hour, under different ciprofloxacin concentrations (Figure \ref{Fig:recruitment}A), and in the \dreca\ and \geneteneighty\ mutants (Figure \ref{Fig:recruitment}B). In the absence of ciprofloxacin, we estimated that 1.3 $\pm$ 1.1 RecB molecules are recruited to DSBs per hour. A previous study had estimated that 18\% of cells generated an endogenous DSB per cell cycle \cite{Sinha2018}. Considering the division time (20 min), this would correspond to a rate of $\sim$0.6 DSBs per hour, a lower value than our own estimate. This discrepancy could be due to the significant differences in the methods used to produce these estimates. In the wild-type, the general pathway for DSB repair suggests that RecBCD is recruited once per DSB (Figure \ref{Fig:pathways}). We can, therefore, reasonably expect that the observed number of RecB recruitments matches the number of DSBs formed (1 to 8 per hour, depending on ciprofloxacin concentration). In the \dreca\ and \geneteneighty\ mutants, however, the DSB repair pathway disruptions lead to multiple RecB recruitments per DSB.

It should be noted that in some cases, ciprofloxacin is expected to produce double-sided DSBs, hence leading to two RecB recruitments per break. We did not take this into account in our estimation of the DSB formation rate, as it has been previously suggested that the two sides of a DSB are kept in close proximity during DNA repair \cite{Vickridge2017,Keyamura2019}, and our imaging setup would not allow us to separate two RecB spots located close together. Indeed, our timelapse images of RecB binding seldom show two spots next to each other, further supporting the idea that we cannot resolve RecBCD binding to both sides of a DSB.

Imaging DSBs in live cells is challenging and was previously achieved using the Gam protein of bacteriophage Mu, which binds to free double-stranded DNA ends \cite{Shee2013}. However, Gam binding to DSBs prevents RecBCD action, and therefore the repair of the breaks. Using RecBCD as a probe allows us to monitor DSB formation in live \ecoli\ in real-time, with single-cell sensitivity and without perturbing the repair process. This tool could be further improved by substituting the Halo tag with a bright and photostable fluorescent protein (as in \cite{Lepore2019a}), enabling long-term imaging, for example, in a mother-machine microfluidic device.

\subsection*{RecB is recruited to DSBs multiple times in the $\mathbf{\Delta}$\emph{reca} and RecB$\mathbf{_{1080}}$ mutants}

\end{figure*}

Our observations of RecB recruitment to DSBs (Figure \ref{Fig:recruitment}) and nucleoid position (Figure \ref{Fig:nucleoid}) in the different mutant strains have led us to the model of RecB recruitment described in Figure \ref{Fig:pathways}, which confirms and extends the model we previously proposed in \cite{Lepore2023}. In wild-type cells, a DSB is recognised by RecBCD, which promotes RecA loading. The RecA filament triggers the SOS response, and is used for homology search and repair. In the \dreca\ mutant, the 3' ssDNA generated by RecBCD is first coated by SSB, and then degraded by the SbcCD and ExoI nucleases \cite{Zahradka2009}. This leads to blunting of the DNA end, creating a new substrate on which RecBCD can bind. This circle leads to multiple RecBCD recruitments per DSB, and eventually to full chromosome degradation. In the \geneteneighty\ mutant, RecBCD unwinds DNA without degrading it. Our data suggests that after the ssDNA is coated with SSB, two competing pathways take place: either DNA degradation by SbcCD and ExoI leading to DNA-end blunting and re-recruitment of RecBCD, or displacement of SSB by RecFOR and loading of RecA, leading to SOS induction and homologous repair.

\subsection*{RecA filaments accumulate under high DNA damage}
Under exposure to high ciprofloxacin concentrations (20-30 ng/ml), we observed an accumulation of cells that contained a RecA filament (Supp. Figures \ref{SIFig:reca_structures}A and \ref{SIFig:reca_structures}B). At these ciprofloxacin concentrations, we have determined that cells undergo frequent DSBs, leading to multiple recruitments of RecB to DSBs over the course of the experiment (up to 8 per hour, Figure \ref{Fig:recruitment}A). Given RecBCD's high processivity \cite{Wiktor2018}, such a high number of RecB recruitments would likely result in several kilobases of DNA being digested at different chromosomal locations, which could result in the complete absence of a homologous copy of the DSB site. In this case, we expect that the repair process will stall at the homology search stage, after formation of the RecA filament, which is consistent with our observation that a large proportion of cells contain RecA filaments following exposure to over-MIC ciprofloxacin concentrations.

\subsection*{RecB colocalises with the bacterial nucleoid}
Imaging RecB simulteanously to the bacterial nucleoid reinforced our interpretation that long-lived RecB spots ($>$10 sec) are DSB-bound RecB molecules, and helped us understand their spatial distribution in the cell. Nucleoid compaction in \ecoli\ had previously been reported after UV irradiation \cite{Odsbu2014}, and we were able to confirm that a similar compaction occurs under ciprofloxacin treatment (Supp. Figure \ref{SIFig:nucleoid_compaction}). As expected, DSB-bound RecB molecules colocalised with the nucleoid. In the \dreca\ and \geneteneighty\ mutants, nucleoid imaging pointed out the involvement of RecA loading (and probably SOS induction) in nucleoid compaction, again confirming previous observations \cite{Odsbu2014}. The absence of any significant nucleoid compaction in the \geneteneighty\ mutant despite its ability to induce the SOS response was surprising, and could result from a significant delay in SOS induction due to the loading of RecA by the RecFOR alternative pathway.

Taken together, this work provides a detailed picture of RecBCD's interaction with DNA following DSBs. We found that RecB dissociation is independent of RecA and that binding time is unaffected by DNA damage levels. Additionally, we observed changes in nucleoid conformation in response to DNA damage and examined the effects of high antibiotic levels on the formation of RecA filaments. The model we developed offers an overview of RecBCD recruitment to DSBs and dissociation from DNA, depending on the strain's ability to effectively carry out or complete repair.
These findings contribute valuable insights into the dynamics of DNA repair mechanisms in \ecoli, suggesting that RecBCD dissociation from DNA is an intrinsic property of the complex, largely unaffected by external factors such as DNA damage levels or RecA loading.
